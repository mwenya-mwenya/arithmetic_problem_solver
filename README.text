The arithmetic_arranger function takes a list of arithmetic problems (expressions) and an optional argument show_answers.
It splits each problem into its components (operands and operator) using split().
The function then checks for various error conditions related to the format of the expressions.
If there are no errors, it creates a reformat_list containing the first operand, operator, and result for each expression.
It determines the maximum lengths needed for formatting (to align the expressions).
The formatted output is built by aligning the operands, operators, and dashes.
If show_answers is True, the results are added to the output.
